# R-tree and LSH Implementation in Python

## Overview

Welcome to the R-tree and LSH Implementation repository! This project is a part of my university coursework, where I've implemented the R-tree and Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) data structures in Python.

## Features

- **R-tree Implementation:**
  - Efficient spatial data indexing using the R-tree structure.
  - Supports insertion, deletion, and searching for spatial objects.

- **Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Implementation:**
  - Approximate nearest neighbor search for high-dimensional data.
  - Configurable hash functions and hash tables for trade-off between accuracy and speed.
